# Description
This script is used to convert video or video/audio media files to modern codecs such as HEVC, VP9 or AV1 (experimental). It walks into a directory and probes media files for video that are not encoded with specified codec (default HEVC). Then it transcodes them. The idea is to use a more modern codec that has a better quality/bitrate ratio. Resulting files are significantly smaller than original h264, mpeg2, mpeg4 or likely any other formats that they are currently encoded to.

tabarnak.py uses [crf](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.265) encoding. All channels are copied. The audio is converted by ffmpeg to ogg vorbis by default.

tabarnak.py wonâ€™t delete or clean up your files. It will skip files that are already done. Basic sanity check is performed after encoding and it will print a warning if the input and output size do not match.

If you plan to use your media files with a chrome cast, be sure the buy **chromecast ultra** since the 3rd generation chromecast does not support HEVC.

## Usage

For help:
python3 tabarnak.py -h

## Requirements
* [python3](https://www.python.org/) (tested with python 3.6.9)
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) in your path

I prepared a tutorial video to learn how to do that on Windows 10:
